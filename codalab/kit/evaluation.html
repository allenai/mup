<H3>Evaluation Criteria</H3>

<p>
	The intrinsic evaluation will be done by ROUGE, using ROUGE-1, -2, -L metrics.
	In addition to that, BERTScore would be used.
	The average of the scores obtained against the multiple summaries would be used for final ranking.
	Please refer to our Github page for further instructions:<a href="https://github.com/allenai/mup">https://github.com/allenai/mup</a>
