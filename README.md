# Multi Perspective Scientific Document Summarization

This repository contains the dataset and baseline models for the Multi Perspective Scientific Document Summarization (MuP) shared task to be held at [SDP in COLING 2022](https://sdproc.org/2022/index.html).

### Intoduction

Generating summaries of scientific documents is known to be a challenging task. Majority of existing work in summarization assumes only one single best gold summary for each given document. Having only one gold summary negatively impacts our ability to evaluate the quality of summarization systems as writing summaries is a subjective activity. At the same time, annotating multiple gold summaries for scientific documents can be extremely expensive as it requires domain experts to read and understand long scientific documents. This shared task will enable exploring methods for generating multi-perspective summaries. We introduce a novel summarization corpus, leveraging data from scientific peer reviews to capture diverse perspectives from the reader's point of view.
